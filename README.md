Good approach to solve some common coding problems 

1.Frequency Counter

this is useful when you have multiple pieces of data multiple inputs you need to compare them to see if they consist of similar values or If they are anagrams of one another ,if a value is contained inside of another value anytime you're comparing pieces of data to inputs or more than two and frequencies of certain things occur.
It does not involve nested loops thus running time is O(n).
