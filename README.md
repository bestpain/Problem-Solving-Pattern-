# Problem-Solving-Pattern-
Good approach to solve some common coding problems 

1.Frequency Counter 

this is useful when you have multiple pieces of data multiple inputs you need to compare them to see if they consist of similar values or If they are anagrams of one another ,if a value is contained inside of another value anytime you're comparing pieces of data to inputs or more than two and frequencies of certain things occur.
It does not involve nested loops thus running time is O(n).

2.Frequency Counter for Characters

this is same as previous question but it is designed to work with string values although it works fine with alphanumeric char but a differnt approach is taken to solve the problem.
time comp:O(n).
